## IOC Collections

This is a collection of malware samples, domains, IPs and URLs that I have identified as malicious for various reasons during my travels.
I tend to hunt based on TTPs and commonalities, usually data points that are most unique. I try to add how I pivoted and found these samples in the decriptions for each commit.
I add these periodically, please note that there is no set schedule :)

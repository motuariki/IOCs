## IOC Collections

This is a collection of malware samples, domains, IPs and URLs that I have identified as malicious for various reasons during my travels.

I hunt based on TTPs and commonalities, usually data points that are most unique. I usually include how I found these indicators in the decriptions for each commit so that you can look for these behaviours in your own environments, and be less focused on the IOCs themselves which are less spicy on the pyramid of pain.

I add these periodically, please note that there is no set schedule :)

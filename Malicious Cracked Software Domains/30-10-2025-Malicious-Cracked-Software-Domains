Additional domains I have discovered based on the orginal research:

'Cracked' software downloads spread via malvertising. Found via malvertising search results, shared ns combo, low host shared IPs, passive dns entry pivots:

filescrack.com (they were also using this as an ns server for a time)

gurutech.click
technologia.icu
thokotech.cc
alitech.click
softtecinfo.com
softshub.net

'ransomware decryptor' domains that direct users to whatsapp channels to get scammed probably. (linked via passive dns record for get-downlaod-here.com > Historical ns entry > 2025-07-22 00:13:02 > 45.14.224.202 > ransomware decrypt domains:
